# RLS Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What I've Implemented

### 1. Database Security Layer
- **Created SQL policies** (`supabase-rls-setup.sql`) that enforce:
  - Users can only access their own data (where `clerkUserId` matches)  
  - Admins can access all data
  - Only admins can delete records

### 2. Authentication Infrastructure  
- **Server-side client** (`lib/supabase-server.ts`) - Uses Clerk JWT for authenticated operations
- **Client-side client** (`lib/supabase-client.ts`) - React hook for authenticated frontend operations

### 3. API Layer Updates
- **Profile API** (`app/api/alumni/profile/route.ts`) - Now uses authenticated client instead of admin bypass
- **Admin APIs** (`app/api/admin/alumni/...`) - Proper admin/user permission handling

### 4. Store Layer
- **RLS-enabled store** (`lib/alumni-store.ts`) - Uses API routes instead of direct DB calls
- Maintains same interface as original store for easy migration

## üéØ Your Next Steps

### Step 1: Configure Clerk JWT Template
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí JWT Templates
2. Create template named "supabase" with this config:
```json
{
  "aud": "authenticated", 
  "exp": {{exp}},
  "iat": {{iat}},
  "iss": "{{iss}}",
  "sub": "{{user.id}}",
  "email": "{{user.primary_email_address.email_address}}",
  "metadata": {
    "role": "{{user.public_metadata.role}}"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Run SQL in Supabase
1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor  
2. Copy and run all commands from `supabase-rls-setup.sql`

### Step 3: No Code Changes Needed! ‚úÖ
Your existing `useAlumniStore` has been updated to use the secure API routes automatically. All your admin and dashboard pages will continue to work exactly as before, but now with proper RLS security.

### Step 4: Test Permissions
- **As regular user**: Should only see own profile data
- **As admin**: Should see all alumni data  
- **Try unauthorized access**: Should be blocked

## üîí Security Benefits You Get

- **Database-level security**: Even if your app code has bugs, the database enforces access rules
- **Automatic user isolation**: Users physically cannot access other users' data  
- **Admin privileges preserved**: Admins retain full access when needed
- **JWT-based authentication**: Leverages Clerk's secure token system
- **Scalable**: Works automatically as you add more users and features

## üö® Important Notes

- **Keep `supabaseAdmin`**: Still needed for admin operations and system tasks
- **Use authenticated clients**: For user-facing operations that should respect RLS
- **Test thoroughly**: Especially admin vs user permissions
- **Monitor logs**: Watch for RLS policy violations during testing

## ‚ùì If Something Goes Wrong

### Can't access data after implementing:
1. Check Clerk JWT template is configured correctly
2. Verify SQL policies were applied in Supabase  
3. Check browser dev tools for authentication errors

### Admin can't access data:
1. Verify admin role is set in Clerk public metadata
2. Check JWT template includes role in metadata
3. Test the `is_admin()` function in Supabase SQL editor

### Users can access other users' data:
1. Verify RLS is enabled: `ALTER TABLE alumni ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
2. Check policies are applied correctly
3. Ensure you're using authenticated client, not admin client

This implementation follows Supabase's best practices and gives you enterprise-grade security! üõ°Ô∏è
